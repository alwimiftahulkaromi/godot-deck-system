# Godot Deck System

This project is a submission for the Programmer (Godot) position at Inner Sight Games.

The project includes a deck system where players can purchase cards through a gacha mechanism in the shop and store them in their inventory. Players can also sell their cards back.

## How to use this project:

Clone or download the project and open it with Godot (version 4.3 or higher).

Press the "Run" button in the top right corner to start the game.

In the Main Menu, there are 3 buttons: "Deck" to open the Inventory, "Shop" to open the Shop, and "Quit" to exit.

The Inventory will be empty the first time it is opened.

Clicking "Sell 1 Random Card" will display debug logs as shown in the image below.

The player's Gold amount will decrease by 100 for every "Draw 10 Cards" action, and the card stock counter for each card will reduce when a card is acquired.
